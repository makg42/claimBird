# Frontend for claimBird

This project includes all relevant frontend related files for claimBird - an innovative chatbot to report damages to your insurance.

Please note:
files located under `HDI/` can be ignored. These are only relevant for demonstration purposes (it's a clonse of the hdi.de website)

We extracted the configuration (just one html and one css file) of the chatbot to `frontend/`.
